problem:

making an extension for firefox, you have to restart firefox to reload your extension

solution:

./quick-firefox URL

kills all firefox
opens firefox using a dev profile (which you've made previously)
sends firefox to a url

failure points:
don't have a dev profile yet?
suggested to turn off session restore for your def profile
